-----------------------------------
**Why we need architecture tests ?**

**Enforcing design guidelines**
Ensures that the development team adheres to established patterns and practices. 

**Maintainability and Code Quality**
Ensures that the architecture adheres to best practices promotes a higher level of code quality and maintainability. It helps in creating a codebase that is easier to understand, modify, and extend over time.

**Prevention of Code Decay**
Architecture tests act as a safety net, preventing the decay of the system's architecture by validating that modifications align with the intended design.

**Scalability and Performance**
Architecture tests can include checks related to scalability and performance aspects. This ensures that the architecture is capable of handling the expected load and meets the performance requirements.
